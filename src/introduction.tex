Originally written as an extension of the C programming language, C++ has evolved over nearly five decades into one of the most powerful and versatile languages in existence. Its combination of low-level memory control and high-level abstraction has made it indispensable for a wide range of applications, from systems programming to high-performance software.

\subsection{Why C++}

\noindent
The question ``Why C++?'' can be interpreted in two distinct ways: ``Why \textsl{learn} C++'' and ``Why \textsl{use} C++?'' The first is much more straightforward, as the reasons to learn C++ are virtually universal.
