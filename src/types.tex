\section{Data Types}

\noindent
At its core, programming is about manipulating and interpreting data.
Data exists in various forms, known as \textit{types}, such as numbers, text, etc.
C++ provides a set of built-in data types, commonly refered to as \textit{primitive types}, which serve as the foundation for computations.
